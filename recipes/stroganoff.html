        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This classic beef stroganoff recipe is a fairly lean version, as most recipes call for more cream. This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes. I like a little thicker version, with just enough sauce to coat the meat. Serve over buttered noodles.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season beef generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes, until liquid evaporates and meat browns.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1 to 2 minutes until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Stir in crème fraîche. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
